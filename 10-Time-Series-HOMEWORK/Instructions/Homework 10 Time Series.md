# Homework 10 Time Series

## Time Series and Regression analysis





For the Time Series Jupyter notebook we used the ARMA ,ARIMA and GARCH models for predictions.  The predictions seemed to differ from one another looking at the charts.

Based on the P values the AMRA and GARCH predictions seemed to be the best fit. The ARIMA results had a high P-Value

The HP filter looks to have worked as intended. The chart  shows a smooth line following the jagged unfiltered "Settle" data



The regression analysis includes a linear regression with lagged values with both in sample performance as well as out.

The prediction using the basic linear regression with a  20 day forecast predicted the vales fairly well farther along in the chart. The MSE and RMSE values for the in-sample and out-sample seemed to have differing numbers from on another. The out-of sample Performance seemed to do better based off MSE.
